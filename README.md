aloha there 👋

this is my personal website, where i write about things i'm interested in, and share some of my projects. it's made with some basic html.

i also used github copilot to build the website (dont attack me for using ai pls)

# about forking this repo

you can fork this, but please change my information with yours. credit is optional but not necessary. i'd appreciate it if you do, though.

it's quite recommended to learn some basics of html and css before forking this, so you can learn how html and css works. after that, you can use github copilot to help you build the website.

anyways

kthxbye

aughh
