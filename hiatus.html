  <h1>Hiatus Announcement</h1>
  <p>Hi. Starting Febuary 15, 2024, I will go on semi-hiatus. This means I am going to be offline every platform expect for Discord. I will keep checking Discord but I wont be active.</p>

  <h1>Why?</h1>
<p>The reason why I'm going on hiatus due to school life and tech issues.</p>
<div class="reason">
  <p>My time at school comes first. Academics face extreme difficulties. Countine in my departments is extremely difficult and discouraging. (for instance, orderly). I'm concerned that I might fail one of my classes. My top priority is passing my classes, not meeting my departmental quota.</p>
  <p>Tech problems come in second and last. The primary problem I have is wanting to use a laptop to play Roblox. I can play on my phone, but it's not very good. It's a Chromebook, but that's my laptop. (Chromebooks are terrible; avoid using them. You'll be sorry you did. If it has Linux mode, that is. A cheap, ridiculous laptop with a Pentium processor from Best Buy or Walmart will function more efficiently than a Chromebook. I'm staring at you, HP. All I detest is your assortment of HP Stream laptops.)  Right now, I'm putting money down for a Windows laptop. (Laptops from Dell and Microsoft seem really nice and elegant. Though not just now. ;))  I'll accomplish my aim in a month or two. It is on the way, but you will have to wait.
  </p>
  
  <h1>Closing</h1>
  <p>That's the whole explanation for my leave of absence.

  I will miss you all, so good bye. 
 
 I will definitely talk in Discord, although not very often.
 
 I'll be back once I obtain a good laptop and things start to improve at school.
 
 Enjoy a pleasant and safe day!
